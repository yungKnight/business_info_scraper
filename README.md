# business_info_scraper
This project is a portfolio project that extracts information for each registered business on the website 'christianlist.gdirect.com',<br>
cleans it up removing businesses that do not have the needed information filled. <br>
Since this is a portfolio project and not legally protected hence the need for me to hide certain info in my scrape code.
<br>
<br>
This code aims to emulate a search result for a specified state
but since all states share the same database, there is no need <br>
for a dynamic or parrallel run for all states in this code.
